# Understading Microplastics in our Waterways

## Microplastic Project Overview:
Microplatics Defintion “Plastic debris can come in all shapes and sizes, those that are less than five millimeters in length (about the size of a sesame seed) are known as “microplastics.” 
This project goal was to show the scale and prevaniness of micrroplatics within our waterways.

Additonally ethical consideration where taken on citing the data. 

## References(Data):
All data used for this project was pull from NOAA. (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration)

The NOAA NCEI global Marine Microplastics product provides access to aggregated, comprehensive, standardized, quality controlled, global data on microplastics in marine settings, from 1972-Present. The database contains information on microplastics concentrations (reported in units based on marine setting - pieces/m3, pieces/10 mins, or pieces kg-1 d.w.), date of collection, latitude and longitude where data was collected, sampling instruments used for collection, and links to publications on the data. The information in this database can be used to improve water quality and protect the ecosystem, especially coastal ecological habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests that help recycle nutrients, serve as breeding grounds for fingerlings, and permanent homes for oysters and other coastal marine wildlife.
