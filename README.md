# Understading Microplastics in our Waterways

## Microplastic Project Overview:
Microplastics Definition: "Plastic debris can come in all shapes and sizes, those that are less than five millimeters in length (about the size of a sesame seed) are known as 'microplastics'."

Microplastics are harmful due to their persistence in the environment, ability to absorb toxic chemicals, ingestion by marine life leading to physical harm and toxicity, promotion of harmful microbial growth, and potential risks to human health through contaminated food and water sources. Their presence poses threats to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human well-being, making them a significant environmental concern.

The goal of this project was to illustrate the scale and pervasiveness of microplastics within our waterways.

## Guide for interactacting the World Microplastic Map: 
Start by using the index to open the map.

Then, select from the list "From Very High to Very Low" levels of Microplastic. Click on a level to populate it on the map.

## Ethical considerations:
This projects was completed through the lense of enviormental justice. Understanding that the fair treatment and meaningful involvement of all people regardless of race, color, national origin, or income, with respect to the development, implementation, and enforcement of environmental laws, regulations, and policies. Additonally ethical consideration where taken on citing the data.

The NOAA NCEI global Marine Microplastics product provides access to aggregated, comprehensive, standardized, quality controlled, global data on microplastics in marine settings, from 1972-Present. The database contains information on microplastics concentrations (reported in units based on marine setting - pieces/m3, pieces/10 mins, or pieces kg-1 d.w.), date of collection, latitude and longitude where data was collected, sampling instruments used for collection, and links to publications on the data. The information in this database can be used to improve water quality and protect the ecosystem, especially coastal ecological habitats such as salt marshes and mangrove forests that help recycle nutrients, serve as breeding grounds for fingerlings, and permanent homes for oysters and other coastal marine wildlife.
